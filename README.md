My entry for Ludum Dare 34 (Compo), created in 48 hours.

[**Play Here**](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=28426)

This was my second (submitted) Ludum Dare game, and the first game I've completed using Unity. The source hasn't been cleaned up yet, so tread with caution!

The majority of the time was spent first implementing the "DSL" for scripting the story, and then using it to write the story itself.
Unfortunately I did not have time to add/create music. 

###Known Bugs
- Game crashes when restarting from the credits screen
